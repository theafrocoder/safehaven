üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Tools for Indexing

To use these with a RAG pipeline, you‚Äôll need tools to parse, clean, and embed text from diverse formats (PDF, HTML, CSV, JSON):
	‚Ä¢	LangChain or Haystack: RAG frameworks for integrating sources and generating responses
	‚Ä¢	Apache Tika: Extract text from PDFs and docs
	‚Ä¢	BeautifulSoup / Playwright: Scrape and clean HTML content
	‚Ä¢	Sentence Transformers: Embed documents for similarity search
	‚Ä¢	FAISS / Weaviate / Chroma: For vector-based retrieval

‚∏ª

üîê Notes on Usage & Licensing
	‚Ä¢	Most datasets above are free to use with attribution (Creative Commons, UN Open Licenses, or Public Domain).
	‚Ä¢	Ensure compliance with GDPR and data privacy rules if integrating user data.
	‚Ä¢	Prioritize localization and cultural sensitivity when selecting sources.

Would you like me to generate a script that scrapes and indexes one of these sources into a vector store for your RAG pipeline?
